## Context

I had a life goal of sorts. It can be summed up by a phrase: **bilingual by thirty**. I emphasise the word _had_ for reasons that I will be turning thirty quite soon with almost 100% certainty that I am, to my dismay, not trilingual. 

However, I am not such a person to give up. I find myself at an opportune time as I am studying coding as well as rekindling my love for the Japanese language. It would make sense then that I would practice my newly found programming skills, albeit basic, to promoting this new linguistic project of mine. When I was 16, I used flashcards to learn hiragana and katakana text. I once again turn to these trustworthy tools, but instead of relying on laminated pieces of paper, it felt more towards the times to try things digitally. This, ladies and gentlemen, led to the application of my basic Java knowledge into a quiz that mimics flashcards. Voilla!

## The program

The program is simple. A Java Swing window will display either a hiragana or katakana character, which the user is prompted for an english representation (i.e. romanji). If "ã‚­" is displayed, for example, the correct romanji would be "ki." And so it goes. One can exit the program by simplying typing "x." Like I said, simple!

## Next steps

Assuming that this project is fruitful in a sense that I continue learning japanese, I see this project expanding into further Japanese learning tools (for my own personal use of course). When my study leads to the inevitable task of learning kanji, perhaps a larger program that quizzes the thousands of cryptic symbols would surface. It is a possibility.
